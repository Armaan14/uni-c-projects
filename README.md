# uni-c-projects
C/C++ projects for PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 1 course at [my university](http://www.aiub.edu/).
Mostly its solutions to problems from ANSI C by E Balagurusamy.


### Some things I do differently:
* I use GNU make (and Makefiles) for compilation _(even though its totally redundant at this scale)_
* I include C++ version of C headers, this is mostly to stay in line with the G++ compiler (instead of GCC)
  > Example:
  > I use `#include <cstdio>` instead of `#include <stdio.h>`
